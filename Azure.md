Azure DevOps Interview Questions & Answers (Beginner & Advanced Level)

This guide includes Azure DevOps interview questions and answers for beginners, advanced professionals and scenario-based questions that are commonly asked in MNC Companies.

Beginner Level Azure DevOps Interview Questions & Answers

1. What is Azure DevOps?

Answer:

Azure DevOps is a cloud-based DevOps service from Microsoft that helps developers plan, develop, test, and deploy applications using CI/CD pipelines, version control, agile project management, and infrastructure automation.

2. What are the key components of Azure DevOps?

Answer:

Azure DevOps consists of five key services:

Azure Repos → Git-based version control

Azure Pipelines → CI/CD automation

Azure Boards → Agile project management

Azure Test Plans → Manual & automated testing

Azure Artifacts → Package management

3. What is Azure Repos?

Answer:

Azure Repos provides Git-based version control and TFVC (Team Foundation Version Control) for managing source code. It supports branching strategies, pull requests, and code reviews.

4. What is Azure Pipelines?

Answer:

Azure Pipelines is a CI/CD automation tool in Azure DevOps that automates build, test, and deployment processes. It supports YAML-based and Classic (GUI) pipelines and integrates with Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, and Helm.

5. What is Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD)?

Answer:

Continuous Integration (CI) → Automatically builds and tests code changes before merging.

Continuous Deployment (CD) → Deploys applications automatically to different environments (Dev, QA, Production).

6. What are the differences between Azure DevOps and Jenkins?

Answer:

Azure DevOps → Cloud-based, built-in Azure integrations, managed CI/CD pipelines.

Jenkins → Self-hosted, requires plugins, more customization.

7. What is YAML in Azure Pipelines?

Answer:

YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) is a declarative format used to define CI/CD pipelines as code in Azure DevOps.

Example YAML pipeline:

trigger:
- main

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

steps:
- task: Docker@2
  inputs:
    command: build
    Dockerfile: Dockerfile
8. What is Azure Test Plans?

Answer:

Azure Test Plans is a manual and automated testing service in Azure DevOps for ensuring software quality through test cases, exploratory testing, and test tracking.

9. What are the different types of triggers in Azure Pipelines?

Answer:

Continuous Integration (CI) Triggers → Automatically starts a pipeline when code changes.

Scheduled Triggers → Runs pipelines at specific intervals.

Manual Triggers → Runs pipelines on-demand.

10. How can you secure secrets in Azure Pipelines?

Answer:

Use Azure Key Vault to store secrets securely.

Use Pipeline Secrets & Variables in Azure DevOps.

Restrict access using RBAC (Role-Based Access Control).

Advanced Level Azure DevOps Interview Questions & Answers

11. What is the difference between Multi-Stage Pipelines and Classic Pipelines?

Answer:

Multi-Stage Pipelines → YAML-based, supports full CI/CD in a single pipeline.

Classic Pipelines → GUI-based, separate build and release pipelines.

12. How do you integrate Azure DevOps with Kubernetes (AKS)?

Answer:

Create an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.

Configure Azure DevOps Service Connection for AKS.

Deploy applications using Helm charts or Kubernetes manifests.

Use kubectl apply or Helm upgrade in Azure Pipelines.

13. How does Azure DevOps handle Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?

Answer:

Azure DevOps supports IaC using:

Terraform for provisioning infrastructure.

Bicep for Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates.

Ansible and Puppet for configuration management.

14. How do you implement rollback in Azure Pipelines?

Answer:

Store previous deployments as artifacts and redeploy on failure.

Use Release Gates to validate before final deployment.

Configure approval workflows for rollback decisions.

15. What is a Self-Hosted Agent in Azure DevOps?

Answer:

A Self-Hosted Agent is a pipeline agent installed on your own machine or VM for running CI/CD jobs instead of using Microsoft-hosted agents.

16. How do you use Azure DevOps Service Connections?

Answer:

Service Connections allow Azure Pipelines to connect to external services like AWS, Azure, Docker Hub, and Kubernetes.

17. How do you manage dependencies in Azure DevOps?

Answer:

Use Azure Artifacts to store and manage dependencies like npm, NuGet, and Maven packages.

Implement versioning and caching strategies in CI/CD pipelines.

18. How do you ensure security in Azure DevOps?

Answer:

Implement RBAC (Role-Based Access Control).

Use Azure Key Vault for secrets management.

Enable pipeline approvals and branch policies.

Use Microsoft Defender for DevOps for vulnerability scanning.

Scenario-Based Azure DevOps Interview Questions & Answers

19. Your production deployment failed. How do you debug and fix it?

Answer:

Check pipeline logs for build or deployment errors.

Verify Kubernetes Pods or VMs for runtime issues.

Rollback to the last successful release using deployment history.

Check Azure Monitor and Log Analytics for system failures.

20. How would you implement Blue-Green Deployment in Azure DevOps?

Answer:

Create two identical environments (blue = current, green = new).

Deploy new version to green environment.

Test and validate green deployment.

Switch traffic from blue to green using Azure Load Balancer or Traffic Manager.

21. How do you handle multi-cloud CI/CD using Azure DevOps?

Answer:

Configure Azure Pipelines Service Connections for AWS/GCP.

Use Terraform or Ansible to provision cloud infrastructure.

Deploy applications using Helm for Kubernetes or CloudFormation for AWS.

22. How do you handle long-running CI/CD pipelines efficiently?

Answer:

Parallelize jobs to reduce execution time.

Use caching and artifact reuse to avoid redundant work.

Implement triggers for only required stages instead of full pipeline execution.

23. How do you handle microservices deployments in Azure DevOps?

Answer:

Use Helm Charts to deploy microservices in Kubernetes.

Implement Service Mesh (Istio, Linkerd) for service discovery and traffic control.

Enable API Gateway to manage external access to microservices.

24. Your team is facing issues with Azure DevOps Pipeline agent capacity. What would you do?

Answer:

Scale up self-hosted agents for high workload pipelines.

Optimize pipelines using caching and parallel execution.

Distribute pipeline jobs across multiple agent pools.

25. How do you monitor and analyze pipeline failures in Azure DevOps?

Answer:

Enable Azure Monitor and Application Insights.

Configure pipeline alerts for failures.

Analyze logs using Azure Log Analytics and KQL queries.

Conclusion

These Azure DevOps interview questions & answers cover basic, advanced, and scenario-based topics commonly asked in MNC Companies.
